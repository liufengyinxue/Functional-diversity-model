Functional diversity models in ecology

For the model based on "Nathan, J., Osem, Y., Shachak, M. & Meron, E. Linking functional diversity to resource availability and disturbance: a mechanistic approach for water-limited plant communities. J Ecol 104, 419–429 (2016).", it is matlab code, and this paper provide it. This is a dynamic model, and the matlab code is quite readable! See "How to simulate  the dynamic model.docx". 

For the model based on "	Adler, P. B., Fajardo, A., Kleinhesselink, A. R. & Kraft, N. J. B. Trait-based tests of coexistence mechanisms. Ecol Lett 16, 1294–1306 (2013).", it is R code, and this paper provide it.
