Functional diversity models in ecology

For the model based on "Nathan, J., Osem, Y., Shachak, M. & Meron, E. Linking functional diversity to resource availability and disturbance: a mechanistic approach for water-limited plant communities. J Ecol 104, 419â€“429 (2016).", and this paper provide the matlab code of the model. This is a dynamic model, and the matlab code is quite readable! See "How to simulate  the dynamic model.docx".
